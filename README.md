# TigerHopping Nightlife Tracker

I built this Nightlife Tracker application as a project for students in my local college. You can easily view the most up to date deals/events being offered by these bars and then indicate where you intend to go based off the information. Users must authenticate themselves through twitter to use the app's RSVP functionality.


### User stories:

* As an unauthenticated user, I can view popular bars in the tigerland area.
* As an unauthenticated user, I can view current deals/event happening in the tigerland area.
* As an authenticated user, I can add myself to a bar to indicate I am going there tonight.


### Built using:

* Node.js
* Express.js
* Twitter's API
* MongoDB

### Notes
* This app communicates with the Tigerland Web Scraper to scrape information from the bars websites and update the twitter status
